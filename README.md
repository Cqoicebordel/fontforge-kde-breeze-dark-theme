# Breeze dark theme for FontForge

This fork takes a lot of the original, but changes to make it more palatable on KDE.

Be mindful that it's a quick and dirty theme, there are bugs, there are issues, and is provided as is.

Below is the original Readme. In the installation paragraph, replace `dark.theme` with `kde-breeze-dark.theme`.

Also, if the images don't load in the UI, you might want to edit their path.

Finally, it took me a while to find it (even tho it's quite visible), but there is an UI editor integrated, in the File menu (below Preferences).
